Infographics I create will be listed here! 

These were originally created for the Rainbow Six Discord, although the Rainbow Six community team has shared them on Twitter [before](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1172260600996605952) [too](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1103385513900285953).
